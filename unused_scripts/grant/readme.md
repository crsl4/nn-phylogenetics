# EDGE Parts of proposal

- Title: "EDGE CT: neural networks for phylogenetic inference" 
- Biographical skecthes

## Project summary (1 page)
- Including intellectual merit and broader impacts

## Project description (15 pages)

- Intellectual Merit: Better/more efficient computational tools to estimate the posterior distribution for genomic data; first time using NN in phylogenetic inference

- Broader impacts: estimation of tree of life for multiple organisms; use of genome-wide data; open-source tools for biologists; crowd-source capability by the creation of an infrastructure that other CS people could expand (module-like like java modules in beast)

- Challenges to enabling diverse organisms: existing tools are ML and MCMC which are not very scalable; introduction of machine learning/NN tools will make phylogenetic inference more scalable to include more species/more genes

- community impact: open source tools for biologists 

- Experimental approach: choice of NN architectures, software options, user-interface, comparison with existing tools in time/memory with simulated/real life data

## Supplementary documents

- Project management plan: only when multiple institutions involved
- Dissemination/education plan (3 pages): workshops/tutorials on our open-source project in conferences: biology (evolution), sacnas, woods hole, organize our own at uw?. An implementation timetable and strategy for evaluation and management of the Dissemination and Education Plan over the award period (four years or less) should be included.
- Letters of collaboration: people at CHTC for the user-interface? biologists with data
- Data Management plan
- Postdoctoral mentoring 
- REU supplement request


## Budget
- Planned REU, ROA, RET, and RAHSS activities are included in the budget request; funds to cover the cost of attendance of the PI and one other member of the project senior personnel, or one trainee (graduate student or postdoc) at an awardee meeting are included in the budget for all funded years.
