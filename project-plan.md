# Neural networks to estimate phylogenetic networks

## Specific goals:
1. Define a NN model that explicitly addresses the symmetries in the data (NN for trees on 4 taxa)
2. Test the NN model on a variety of different simulations to assess robustness to noise and generalization
    - Study data used in existing papers to replicate simulation scenarios: [Zou2020](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/5/1495/5685817), [Suvorov2019](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/69/2/221/5559282), [Kayondo2020](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=99342)
    - Compare our NN model to other NN models in literature
3. Compare our NN model to other phylogenetic approaches: maximum likelihood, bayesian, parsimony, distance-based...
4. Test on a real-life data


## Timeline 
(need to agree on this)


## Future work
1. Can we predict bigger trees?
2. Can we exploit more symmetries in the data?
